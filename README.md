# Uno
 In a group project, we implemented a terminal-based Uno game in OCaml. We made a solo player Uno-Solitaire game and a multiplayer original Uno game. Uno could be played against other players or against AIs on 3 different difficulties. The state of any game could be saved and loaded to and from a file through commands.

An example of saving the state of an uno game can be see above in the file:
