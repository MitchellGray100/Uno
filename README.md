# Uno
 In a group project, we implemented a terminal-based Uno game in OCaml. We made a solo player Uno-Solitaire game and a multiplayer original Uno game. Uno could be played against other players or against AIs on 3 different difficulties. The state of any game could be saved and loaded to and from a file through commands.

I directly worked on: saving and loading,  the AIs, testing every component of our project using the test.ml file (Over 1000 lines of tests), terminal commands, and other smaller tasks.
An example of saving the state of an uno game can be seen above in the file:
